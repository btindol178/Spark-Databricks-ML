Her life is a struggle on some levels, but that is nothing compared to what happens when her mom hooks up with Jake Carter. Then both of their lives take a turn for the worse. The two women are transported into a living hell of extreme physical and emotion abuse.Ms. McEntire's portrayal of these particular scenes is gut wrenching. It was written so well that I actually had to put the book down and have a moment of tears for what the story of these two women represents. It is important that the reader make it through this piece because it really lays the foundation for what Robyn goes through and the young woman she becomes.Just when Robyn thinks there is no hope, she gets a break and makes her escape from Texas to Kentucky. She may have escaped one danger, but lands in the lap of something potentially more deadly. She takes up with a group of Watchers who are actually vampires sworn to protect civilian vampires and humans from rogue vampires.It is an excellent story about despair, newfound hope, personal discovery, and love, filled with a good amount of action. Even though parts of this story were difficult for me to read, I am glad that I did, and am truly looking forward to the next book in the Watchers series.Reviewed at Bitten by Books Paranormal Fiction Review Site by Rachel</td><td>12 8, 2008</td><td>A10K1JMIPOWD0I</td><td>Rachel P.

It was absolutely wonderful and the characters will steal your heart :)Brace yourself when you start to read this book. The beginning will have you an emotional wreck.  It sure did me. I was so angry and sad all at the same time. I felt absolutely horrible for Robyn and all that she went through. She endured a lot of abuse and it really got to me.Robyn was a very strong young lady. She went through things that most people wouldn't survive yet she kept going and doing the best that she could.  When she meets Trigg, I immediately adored him. He is so very charming and mysterious. But then you learn that he's so much more. He is very caring and has a really big heart especially when it comes to Robyn. I loved how as soon as he laid eyes on her he was protective of her and wanted to do nothing but help her and show her that not everyone was going to hurt her. Everything about him will make you love him.\"Before you came into my life. I wanted nothing and no one. I lived day in and day out caring only about my mission to seek out and destroy Rogues. You have shown me something I have never felt before-love. I almost lost you and I couldn't bare it. Will you have me as your mate?\"Then she meets Trigg's friends, Vane and Rayne. They both welcome her just as Trigg did and accept her in their lives. They all help her to grow and show her the good that is in the world. They all help her to open up her mind and she finally feels safe and at home with them.I really enjoyed seeing their love for one another grow and that no matter what they learned about each other they still wanted to be with one another. Even when she discovers who Trigg really is, she isn't afraid of him and trusts him.  I loved and mean loved getting to know about the watchers and vampires in this book. The guys are all three amazing and I instinctively loved all of them.  I loved all of the characters in this book with the exception of those who hurt Robyn and her mother.I was so glad when Robyn met Rosa, Darla, Phillip, & Abigail. They all pretty much became like family to her, she finally had friends and that made me so very happy. Rosa was great to Robyn from the start and helped her out which made me love her that much more.Now brace yourself for the end of the book as well. I couldn't help it, I cried because of what happened. Robyn truly had one of the biggest hearts and very courageous which she shows near the end when she saves Darla & Abigail. I was so happy that Robyn gets to see her mother again. Even though she's faced with a decision that could forever change her life. I don't want to give too much away, but I was so rooting for a happy ending at this point and hoping that Trigg and Robyn would get the ending they so much deserved. Thankfully the more I read the happier I got. I was beyond ecstatic for the two of them.I can't wait to get to read the next book in this series so I can see where things go for Vane and Rosa because I loved both of them in this one.</td><td>10 5, 2013</td><td>A1FOA6ZJTM31O3</td><td>VernaDene</td><td>Completely Adore Trigg!!</td><td>1380931200</td></tr><tr><td>B001CN45KU</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>4.0</td><td>Ok book, not one of mb's best.

But he can&#8217;t seem to harden his heart against the petite woman who looks so lost standing in the rain.  He knows that that a future for them is impossible, she&#8217;s human, he&#8217;s a vampire, but she&#8217;s someone special. But the past is catching up and it has a way of changing destinies.This steady to fast paced plot keeps the reader engaged from beginning to end with well written scenes, vivid images and great compelling characters.  The author does such a fantastic job of giving these characters life that the reader can&#8217;t help but become enamored and want to know more.  As the reader gets caught up in the lives of Trigg and Robyn they are swept along with the Watchers missions as they battle the rogues and get their adrenalin pumping.The attraction between Trigg and Robyn is such a sweet passion that burns super hot at the same time.  The author conveys that chemistry and their relationship with such intensity that it captures the imagination. The reader can&#8217;t help but feel for these two characters, Robyn&#8217;s such a strong and sweet person that has been through hell and Trigg is this tough vampire that has such tender feelings for this lost waif, how can the reader not fall in love with them.  Even the sex scenes are contradictory in the fact that he is so sweet and tender but carries away by hot steamy lust that it takes the reader&#8217;s breath away.I can&#8217;t wait to read the next book in this wonderful and entertaining vampire world, Vane, Rosa and Rayne have definitely caught my attention and I want to know more about them as well as the Watchers.</td><td>01 16, 2014</td><td>ASVY5XSYJ1XOE</td><td>Evampire</td><td>Midnight Reborn Review</td><td>1389830400</td></tr><tr><td>B001CN45IC</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>3.0</td><td>I was hooked from the very beginning of this story.

We saw the extremely handsome man Warwick really was.The passion and romace are well mixed with so much strengh and wit from both characters that sometimes you're not sure who the real Hero should be in this story.For everyone who likes the strong-take matters into her own hands Heroines--this is definately the book for you!
